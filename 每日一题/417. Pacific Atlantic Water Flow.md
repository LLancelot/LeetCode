## 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.

Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.

Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.

**Note:**

1. The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
2. Both *m* and *n* are less than 150.

 

**Example:**

```
Given the following 5x5 matrix:

  Pacific ~   ~   ~   ~   ~ 
       ~  1   2   2   3  (5) *
       ~  3   2   3  (4) (4) *
       ~  2   4  (5)  3   1  *
       ~ (6) (7)  1   4   5  *
       ~ (5)  1   1   2   4  *
          *   *   *   *   * Atlantic

Return:

[[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [3, 0], [3, 1], [4, 0]] (positions with parentheses in above matrix).
```

### 代码

- DFS 

```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, matrix):
        # Check for an empty graph.
        if not matrix:
            return []

        p_visited = set()
        a_visited = set()
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))

        def traverse(i, j, visited):
            if (i, j) in visited:
                return
            visited.add((i, j))
            # Traverse neighbors.
            for direction in directions:
                next_i, next_j = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
                if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
                    # Add in your question-specific checks.
                    if matrix[next_i][next_j] >= matrix[i][j]:
                        traverse(next_i, next_j, visited)

        for row in range(rows):
            traverse(row, 0, p_visited)
            traverse(row, cols - 1, a_visited)

        for col in range(cols):
            traverse(0, col, p_visited)
            traverse(rows - 1, col, a_visited)

        return list(p_visited & a_visited)
```



- BFS

```python

        return solve(grid)

def solve(grid):
    if not grid or len(grid[0]) == 0:
        return []
    global n, m, st
    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    st = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)] # use 2 bits, 01 for Pacific, 10 for Atlantic, 11 for both
    
    for i in range(n):
        dfs(i, 0, 1, grid)
    for i in range(n):
        dfs(i, m-1, 2, grid)
    for j in range(m):
        dfs(0, j, 1, grid)
    for j in range(m):
        dfs(n-1, j, 2, grid)
        
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if st[i][j] == 3:
                # both can flow
                res.append([i, j])
    return res


def dfs(x, y, k, grid):
    global st

    st[x][y] |= k
    for i in range(4):
        new_x, new_y = x + dx[i], y + dy[i]
        global n, m
        if (new_x >= 0 and new_x < n and new_y >= 0 and new_y < m and grid[x][y] <= grid[new_x][new_y]):
