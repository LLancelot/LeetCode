## 450. Delete Node in a BST

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-105 <= key <= 105`



### 代码

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (key < root.val) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
        else if (key > root.val) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
        else {
            if (root.left == null) return root.right;
            if (root.right == null) return root.left;
            
            // find the left-most corner of right sub tree
            TreeNode p = root.right;
            while (p.left != null) p = p.left;
            p.left = root.left;
            return root.right;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
