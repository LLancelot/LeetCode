## 1165. Single-Row Keyboard

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/

There is a special keyboard with **all keys in a single row**.

Given a string `keyboard` of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index `i` to index `j` is `|i - j|`.

You want to type a string `word`. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"
Output: 73
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `keyboard.length == 26`
- `keyboard` contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
- `1 <= word.length <= 10^4`
- `word[i]` is an English lowercase letter.

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateTime(String keyboard, String word) {
        Map<Character, Integer> pos = new HashMap<>();
        char[] s = keyboard.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
            pos.put(s[i], i);
        char[] w = word.toCharArray();
        int res = 0, t = 0;
        for (char c : w) {
            res += Math.abs(pos.get(c) - t);
            t = pos.get(c);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
