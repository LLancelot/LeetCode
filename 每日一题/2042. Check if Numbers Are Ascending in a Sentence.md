## 2042. Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-numbers-are-ascending-in-a-sentence/

A sentence is a list of **tokens** separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a **positive number** consisting of digits `0-9` with no leading zeros, or a **word** consisting of lowercase English letters.

- For example, `"a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs"` is a sentence with seven tokens: `"2"` and `"4"` are numbers and the other tokens such as `"puppy"` are words.

Given a string `s` representing a sentence, you need to check if **all** the numbers in `s` are **strictly increasing** from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, **each** number is **strictly smaller** than the number on its **right** in `s`).

Return `true` *if so, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

![example-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/example1.png)

```
Input: s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles"
Output: true
Explanation: The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.
They are strictly increasing from left to right: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "hello world 5 x 5"
Output: false
Explanation: The numbers in s are: 5, 5. They are not strictly increasing.
```

**Example 3:**

![example-3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/example3.png)

```
Input: s = "sunset is at 7 51 pm overnight lows will be in the low 50 and 60 s"
Output: false
Explanation: The numbers in s are: 7, 51, 50, 60. They are not strictly increasing.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "4 5 11 26"
Output: true
Explanation: The numbers in s are: 4, 5, 11, 26.
They are strictly increasing from left to right: 4 < 5 < 11 < 26.
```



### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areNumbersAscending(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        int pre = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {
                int cur = Integer.parseInt(word);
                if (cur <= pre)
                    return false;
                else pre = cur;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
