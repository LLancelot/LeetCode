## 563. Binary Tree Tilt

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the sum of every tree node's **tilt**.*

The **tilt** of a tree node is the **absolute difference** between the sum of all left subtree node **values** and all right subtree node **values**. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node **values** is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tile of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt3.jpg)

```
Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.sum = 0
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            left = helper(node.left)
            right = helper(node.right)
            self.sum += abs(left - right)
            return left + right + node.val
        helper(root)
        return self.sum
```
