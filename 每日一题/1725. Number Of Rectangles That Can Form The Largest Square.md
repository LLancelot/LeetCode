##  1725. Number Of Rectangles That Can Form The Largest Square

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-rectangles-that-can-form-the-largest-square/

You are given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, wi]` represents the `ith` rectangle of length `li` and width `wi`.

You can cut the `ith` rectangle to form a square with a side length of `k` if both `k <= li` and `k <= wi`. For example, if you have a rectangle `[4,6]`, you can cut it to get a square with a side length of at most `4`.

Let `maxLen` be the side length of the **largest** square you can obtain from any of the given rectangles.

Return *the **number** of rectangles that can make a square with a side length of* `maxLen`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[5,8],[3,9],[5,12],[16,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The largest squares you can get from each rectangle are of lengths [5,3,5,5].
The largest possible square is of length 5, and you can get it out of 3 rectangles.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[2,3],[3,7],[4,3],[3,7]]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length <= 1000`
- `rectangles[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= li, wi <= 109`
- `li != wi`

### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def countGoodRectangles(self, rec: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        maxLen, cnt = 0, 0
        for r in rec:
            minv = min(r[0], r[1])
            if minv > maxLen:
                maxLen = minv
                cnt = 1
            elif minv == maxLen:
                cnt += 1
        return cnt
```
