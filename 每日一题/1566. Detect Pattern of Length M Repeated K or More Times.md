## 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times

Given an array of positive integers `arr`, find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times.

A **pattern** is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times **consecutively** without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return `true` *if there exists a pattern of length* `m` *that is repeated* `k` *or more times, otherwise return* `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Notice that the pattern (1,2) exists twice but not consecutively, so it doesn't count.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2], m = 2, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The only pattern of length 2 is (2,2) however it's repeated only twice. Notice that we do not count overlapping repetitions.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= m <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 100`

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsPattern(int[] arr, int m, int k) {
        if (m > arr.length || m * k > arr.length) return false;
        
        for(int i = 0, j = i + m, count = 0; j < arr.length; ++i, ++j) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[j]) {
                count = 0;
            } else if (++count == (k - 1) * m) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
