## 1854. Maximum Population Year

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is **not** counted in the year that they die.

Return *the **earliest** year with the **maximum population***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
- `1950 <= birth i < death i <= 2050`

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
        int res = 0, cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1950; i <= 2050; i++) {
            int s = 0;
            for (int[] log : logs) {
                if (i >= log[0] && i < log[1]) 
                    s++;
            }
            if (s > cnt) {
                res = i;
                cnt = s;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
