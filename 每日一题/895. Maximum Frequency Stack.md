## 895. Maximum Frequency Stack

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/

Implement `FreqStack`, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
```

 

**Note:**

- Calls to `FreqStack.push(int x)` will be such that `0 <= x <= 10^9`.
- It is guaranteed that `FreqStack.pop()` won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
- The total number of `FreqStack.push` calls will not exceed `10000` in a single test case.
- The total number of `FreqStack.pop` calls will not exceed `10000` in a single test case.
- The total number of `FreqStack.push` and `FreqStack.pop` calls will not exceed `150000` across all test cases.



### 代码

```java
class FreqStack {

    Map<Integer, Integer> freq;
    Map<Integer, Stack<Integer>> group;
    int maxfreq;
    
    public FreqStack() {
        freq = new HashMap();
        group = new HashMap();
        maxfreq = 0;
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        int f = freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1;
        freq.put(x, f);
        if (f > maxfreq) maxfreq = f;
        
        group.computeIfAbsent(f, z -> new Stack()).push(x);
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        int x = group.get(maxfreq).pop();
        freq.put(x, freq.get(x) - 1);
        if (group.get(maxfreq).size() == 0)
            maxfreq--;
        return x;
    }
}

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 */
