## 135. Candy (hard)

https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/

There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        if (ratings == null && ratings.length == 0)
            return 0;
      
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
      
      	// sum up all the candies
        int sum = candies[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
            sum += candies[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
