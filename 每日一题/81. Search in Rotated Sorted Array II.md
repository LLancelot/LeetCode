## 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

**Follow up:**

- This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

### 代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            while l < mid and nums[l] == nums[mid]: # tricky part
                l += 1
            # the first half is ordered
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                # target is in the first half
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            # the second half is ordered
            else:
                # target is in the second half
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return False
```
