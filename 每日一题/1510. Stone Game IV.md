## 1510. Stone Game IV

https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a *move* consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`



### 思路

- ```dp[i]``` means the result (win/lose) for ```n = i``` 

  if there is any ```k``` that makes ```dp[i - k^2] == false```, it means we can make Bob lose the game.

  then, we mark ```dp[i] = true```

   

### 代码

- O(Time) = ```O(N*sqrt(N)) = O(N^1.5)```

  O(Space) = ```O(N)```

```java
 	public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int k = 1; k * k <= i; ++k) {
                if (!dp[i - k * k]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
```
