## 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return *the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by* `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int remainders[] = new int[60];
        int count = 0;
        for (int t: time) {
            if (t % 60 == 0) { // check if a%60==0 && b%60==0
                count += remainders[0];
            } else { // check if a%60+b%60==60
                count += remainders[60 - t % 60];
            }
            remainders[t % 60]++; // remember to update the remainders
        }
        return count;
    }
```
