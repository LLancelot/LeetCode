## 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

- `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return *the **final** value of* `X` *after performing all the operations*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.

### 代码

- Tips: 只看第二个字符判断操作符即可。

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int start = 0;
        for (String op : operations) {
            start = op.charAt(1) == '+' ? start + 1 : start - 1;
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
