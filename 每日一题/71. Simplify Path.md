## 71. Simplify Path

https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/

Given an **absolute path** for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the **canonical path**.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period `'..'` moves the directory up a level.

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `'/'`, and there must be only a single slash `'/'` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) **must not** end with a trailing `'/'`. Also, the canonical path must be the **shortest** string representing the absolute path. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid Unix path.

### 代码

- Using stack

```python
class Solution(object):
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        stack = []
        for p in path.split("/"):
            if p == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
			elif p == "." or not p:
                continue
            else:
                stack.append(p)
       
    	res = "/" + "/".join(stack)
        return res
```
