## 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two

   

  existing

   

  characters.

  - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`

- Operation 2: Transform

   

  every

   

  occurrence of one

   

  existing

   

  character into another

   

  existing

   

  character, and do the same with the other character.

  - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` *if* `word1` *and* `word2` *are **close**, and* `false` *otherwise.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "aabbss"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any amount of operations.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105`
- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.



### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        c1, c2 = Counter(word1), Counter(word2)
        return all([len(word1) == len(word2), 
                    c1.keys() == c2.keys(),
                    sorted(c1.values()) == sorted(c2.values())])
```
