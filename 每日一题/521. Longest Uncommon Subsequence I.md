## 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/

Given two strings `a` and `b`, find the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between them.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in `"aebdc"` to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other**.

Return *the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between `a` and `b`*. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if (a.equals(b)) return -1;
        return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
}
```
