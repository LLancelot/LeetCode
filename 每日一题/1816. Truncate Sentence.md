## 1816. Truncate Sentence

https://leetcode.com/problems/truncate-sentence/

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

- For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, and `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.

You are given a sentence `s` and an integer `k`. You want to **truncate** `s` such that it contains only the **first** `k` words. Return `s`* after **truncating** it.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of words in s]`.
- `s` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.



### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res.append(words[i]);
            if (i < k - 1) res.append(" ");
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
```
