# 139. Word Break

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]

Output: false
```

### 代码

- DP,  dp[i] means s[:i+1] can be segmented into words in the wordDicts 

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [False for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
        # dp[i] means s[:i+1] can be segmented into words in the wordDicts 
        dp[0] = True
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                if dp[i] and s[i:j+1] in wordDict:
                    dp[j+1] = True
        
        return dp[-1]
