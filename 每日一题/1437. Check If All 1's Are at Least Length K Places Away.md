## 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/

Given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s and an integer `k`, return `True` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1], k = 1
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
- `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`



### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        cnt = k
        for x in nums:
            if x == 1:
                if cnt < k:
                    return False
                cnt = 0
            else:
                cnt += 1
        
        return True
```
