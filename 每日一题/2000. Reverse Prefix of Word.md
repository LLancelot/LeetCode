## 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/

Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

- For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` (**inclusive**). The resulting string will be `"dcbaefd"`.

Return *the resulting string*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
```

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int pos = -1, nextPos = -1;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        char[] str = word.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            if (str[i] == ch) {
                pos = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (pos == -1) return word;	// no need to reverse
        nextPos = pos + 1;
        while (pos >= 0) {		// reverse str[0...pos]
            sb.append(str[pos]);
            pos--;
        }
        sb.append(word.substring(nextPos));
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
