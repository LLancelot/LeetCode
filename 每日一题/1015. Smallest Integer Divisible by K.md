## 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/

Given a positive integer `K`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit `1`.

Return *the **length** of* `N`. If there is no such `N`, return -1.

**Note:** `N` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= K <= 105`

### 思路

- Straight forward: using modulo, try {1, 11, 111, 1111...} % K, check if it's divisible.

### 代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K):
        temp = 0
        for i in range(1, K+1):
            temp = (temp * 10 + 1) % K
            if temp == 0:
                return i
        return -1
```
