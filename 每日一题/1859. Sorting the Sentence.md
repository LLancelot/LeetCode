## 1859. Sorting the Sentence

https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be **shuffled** by appending the **1-indexed word position** to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

- For example, the sentence `"This is a sentence"` can be shuffled as `"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"` or `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`.

Given a **shuffled sentence** `s` containing no more than `9` words, reconstruct and return *the original sentence*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
Output: "Me Myself and I"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `1` to `9`.
- The number of words in `s` is between `1` and `9`.
- The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
- `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.



### 代码

- `strs ` 存放split后带序号的单词，`words` 存放去除序号后的单词

```java
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] strs = s.split(" ");
        int n = strs.length;
        String[] words = new String[n];
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (String str : strs) {
            int pos = str.charAt(str.length() - 1) - '0';
            words[pos - 1] = str.substring(0, str.length() - 1);
        }
        for (String word : words) {
            res.append(word + " ");
        }
        res.deleteCharAt(res.length() - 1);
        return res.toString();
    }
}
