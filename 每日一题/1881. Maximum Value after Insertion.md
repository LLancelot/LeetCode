## 1881. Maximum Value after Insertion

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-after-insertion/

You are given a very large integer `n`, represented as a string, and an integer digit `x`. The digits in `n` and the digit `x` are in the **inclusive** range `[1, 9]`, and `n` may represent a **negative** number.

You want to **maximize** `n`**'s numerical value** by inserting `x` anywhere in the decimal representation of `n`. You **cannot** insert `x` to the left of the negative sign.

- For example, if `n = 73` and `x = 6`, it would be best to insert it between `7` and `3`, making `n = 763`.
- If `n = -55` and `x = 2`, it would be best to insert it before the first `5`, making `n = -255`.

Return *a string representing the **maximum** value of* `n`* after the insertion*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = "99", x = 9
Output: "999"
Explanation: The result is the same regardless of where you insert 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = "-13", x = 2
Output: "-123"
Explanation: You can make n one of {-213, -123, -132}, and the largest of those three is -123.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n.length <= 105`
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- The digits in `n` are in the range `[1, 9]`.
- `n` is a valid representation of an integer.
- In the case of a negative `n`, it will begin with `'-'`.



### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public String maxValue(String n, int x) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
            if (n.charAt(0) != '-' && n.charAt(i) - '0' < x || n.charAt(0) == '-' && n.charAt(i) - '0' > x)
                return n.substring(0, i) + x + n.substring(i);
        }
        return n + x;
    }
}
```
