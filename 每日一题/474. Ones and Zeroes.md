## 474. Ones and Zeroes

https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return *the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most*** `m` `0`*'s and* `n` `1`*'s in the subset*.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists only of digits `'0'` and `'1'`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

            int cm = 0, cn = 0;          
            for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
                if (ch == '0') cm++;
                else cn++;
            }
            for (int i = m; i >= cm; i--) {
                for (int j = n; j >= cn; j--) {
                    f[i][j] = Math.max(f[i][j], f[i - cm][j - cn] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return f[m][n];
    }
}
