# 929. Unique Email Addresses

## [题目](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/)

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain `'.'`s or `'+'`s.

If you add periods (`'.'`) between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"` and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address. (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus (`'+'`) in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign will be **ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example `m.y+name@email.com` will be forwarded to `my@email.com`. (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of `emails`, we send one email to each address in the list. How many different addresses actually receive mails? 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
```

## 思路

- 先把每个字符串，分成 local 和 domain 两部分，用 ```email.split("@")```
- 对于 local 部分，只取+号前的部分，并去掉 . 号
- 最后将两部分拼接，放到```unique = set()``` 的集合中。返回集合元素个数，即唯一的地址数。

        for email in emails:
            local, domain = email.split("@")
            local = local.split("+")[0].replace(".", "")
            unique.add(local + "@" + domain)
        
        return len(unique)
```
