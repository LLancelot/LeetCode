## 1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros

https://leetcode.com/problems/longer-contiguous-segments-of-ones-than-zeros/

Given a binary string `s`, return `true` *if the **longest** contiguous segment of* `1`*s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of* `0`*s in* `s`. Return `false` *otherwise*.

- For example, in `s = "110100010"` the longest contiguous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`s, then the longest contiguous segment of `0`s is considered to have length `0`. The same applies if there are no `1`s.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: true
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "110100010"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.



### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkZeroOnes(String s) {
        int one = 0, zero = 0; // 最大连续的0，1个数
        int s0 = 0, s1 = 0;	// 当前连续的0，1个数
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '0') {
                s0++;
                s1 = 0;
            } else {
                s0 = 0;
                s1++;
            }
            one = Math.max(one, s1);
            zero = Math.max(zero, s0);
        }
        return one > zero;
    }
}
```
