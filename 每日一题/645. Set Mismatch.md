## 645. Set Mismatch

https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return *them in the form of an array*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        boolean[] f = new boolean[10010];
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (f[x]) {
                res[0] = x;
            }
            f[x] = true;
        }
        for (int x = 1; x < 10010; x++)
            if (!f[x]) {
                res[1] = x; break;
            }
        return res;
    }
}
```
