## 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/

You are given an array representing a row of `seats` where `seats[i] = 1` represents a person sitting in the `ith` seat, and `seats[i] = 0` represents that the `ith` seat is empty **(0-indexed)**.

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return *that maximum distance to the closest person*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: seats = [0,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 104`
- `seats[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- At least one seat is **empty**.
- At least one seat is **occupied**.

### 代码

```python
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats):
        dis = 0
        pos = [i for i in range(len(seats)) if seats[i] == 1] # get seated positions
        if len(pos) == 1: # if only one seat
            if 0 < pos[0] < len(seats):
                # if seat between two ends
                return max(pos[0], len(seats)-1 - pos[0])
            else:
                # seat at seats[0] or seats[-1]
                return len(seats) - 1
        
        dis = max(pos[0] - 0, len(seats)-1 - pos[-1])	# calculate two ends
        for i in range(len(pos)-1):
            # culculate between two seats
            dis = max(dis, (pos[i+1] - pos[i])//2)
        return dis
```
